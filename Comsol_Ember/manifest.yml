name: Comsol job on Ember general nodes
notes: Note that CHPC only has 2 consecutive users Comsol license that does not include the Cluster support. Therefore we can only run Comsol on one node at a time and use Comsol's built in multithreading to run on all the node's cores. This job uses user's group allocation, supplied in the "Account" section; will not work if group does not have an allocation.<br>Lumerical license is currently open to all users but if user belongs to a research group that has not been part of the campus agreement, please, notify CHPC for further steps.
